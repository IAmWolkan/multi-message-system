# multi-message-system

This is a project I work on where I am able to test to write code in multiple languages and frameworks.

The project only has one simple frontend due to it being focused on the backen technology and not a pretty frontend, it only has to be functional.

Each backend consists of a selected programming language and a framework and they can be found under the folder backends under the src folder with the format {language}/{framework}.

Each backend will have it's own docker-compose file with all the services and images needed to run each backend.

This project is an always ongoing project and will never be considered done, I will also not focus on making it 100% perfect and bugg free but I will always try to keep it functional for anyone to test out.

I am always looking for ways to improve what I am writing and always eager to learn more so if you see something I could have done better in a backend please send in an PR and let me know, all feedback is appreciated!
